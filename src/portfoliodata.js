    description: `Inspired by leading job boards, FoodCruitment is a dedicated platform for job seekers in the food industry, from chefs to nutritionists.\n\nDeveloped with React and React Router DOM, this site uses Firestore and Firebase for data management and secure user authentication, marking my first project that extends beyond local storage. It introduced complex features such as login and sign-in components that allow recruiters and companies to post job advertisements.\n\nThe job submission page utilises React Forms; recruiters complete a form which is then sent to Google, creating a makeshift API that populates the homepage with job listings.\n\nCurrently, the application is basic, requiring candidates to email their CVs. Future enhancements will include a comprehensive job board portal for both recruiters and candidates to manage job applications and responses.\n\nAdditional planned features include a nutrition news feed using a news API and helpful advice and tips for job seekers, enhancing the site's focus on the nutritional sector.`,
